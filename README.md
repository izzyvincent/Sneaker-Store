# React + Vite

Sneaker Store - README

Hey there! Welcome to My Sneaker Store, a one-page site built with React and Vite for an assignment and to show how easy it is to favorite them. Here’s a quick rundown:

	• A single-page store where you can favorite (♥) items.
	• Built using React, styled with Tailwind, and set up via Vite.
	• Pulls product data from a JSON file (because fake data for the win).

How to get started: 

    1. Clone or Download this repo.
	2. Open a terminal, go into the project folder, and run:
        npm install
        npm run dev
    3. That’s it! The app will spin up, and you can check it out in your browser at whichever URL Vite mentions.
